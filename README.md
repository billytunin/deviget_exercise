# Local deploy
Install NPM dependencies by using ```npm install```<br><br>
Whenever we issue ```npm start``` on the terminal, Webpack will automatically run a local server in which we will be able to see our app. Livereload and SASS-watch are activated on this command aswell; meaning that any change to the code will cause the page to reload and reflect the new changes (after compiling SASS to CSS in case there was any change on those files).
